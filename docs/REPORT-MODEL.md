# Overview

In UReport2, cells show an dependency relationship to each other. You can set the left and top parent cell for any cell. The parent cell can be chosen by the user. By default, the left parent cell to a cell refers to the nearest-left cell in the same row; and the top parent cell is the nearest-upper cell in the same column. If a cell is located in the first row, it has no top parent cell by default; and if it is located in the first column, it has no left parent cell by default. Open the UReport2 report designer and select any cell. You can see its upper or left parent cell at its properties panel.
